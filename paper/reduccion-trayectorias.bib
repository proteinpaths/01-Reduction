@article{Hobohm1992,
abstract = {The Protein Data Bank currently contains about 600 data sets of three-dimensional protein coordinates determined by X-ray crystallography or NMR. There is considerable redundancy in the data base, as many protein pairs are identical or very similar in sequence. However, statistical analyses of protein sequence-structure relations require nonredundant data. We have developed two algorithms to extract from the data base representative sets of protein chains with maximum coverage and minimum redundancy. The first algorithm focuses on optimizing a particular property of the selected proteins and works by successive selection of proteins from an ordered list and exclusion of all neighbors of each selected protein. The other algorithm aims at maximizing the size of the selected set and works by successive thinning out of clusters of similar proteins. Both algorithms are generally applicable to other data bases in which criteria of similarity can be defined and relate to problems in graph theory. The largest nonredundant set extracted from the current release of the Protein Data Bank has 155 protein chains. In this set, no two proteins have sequence similarity higher than a certain cutoff (30{\%} identical residues for aligned subsequences longer than 80 residues), yet all structurally unique protein families are represented. Periodically updated lists of representative data sets are available by electronic mail from the file server "netserv@embl-heidelberg.de." The selection may be useful in statistical approaches to protein folding as well as in the analysis and documentation of the known spectrum of three-dimensional protein structures.},

abstract = {The ability to perform long, accurate molecular dynamics (MD) simulations involving proteins and other biological macro-molecules could in principle provide answers to some of the most important currently outstanding questions in the fields of biology, chemistry, and medicine. A wide range of biologically interesting phenomena, however, occur over timescales on the order of a millisecond---several orders of magnitude beyond the duration of the longest current MD simulations. We describe a massively parallel machine called Anton, which should be capable of executing millisecond-scale classical MD simulations of such biomolecular systems. The machine, which is scheduled for completion by the end of 2008, is based on 512 identical MD-specific ASICs that interact in a tightly coupled manner using a specialized highspeed communication network. Anton has been designed to use both novel parallel algorithms and special-purpose logic to dramatically accelerate those calculations that dominate the time required for a typical MD simulation. The remainder of the simulation algorithm is executed by a programmable portion of each chip that achieves a substantial degree of parallelism while preserving the flexibility necessary to accommodate anticipated advances in physical models and simulation methods.},

abstract = {Recent advances in computing technology have enabled microsecond long all-atom molecular dynamics ( MD) simulations of biological systems. Methods that can distill the salient features of such large trajectories are now urgently needed. Conventional clustering methods used to analyze MD trajectories suffer from various setbacks, namely (i) they are not data driven, (ii) they are unstable to noise and changes in cut-off parameters such as cluster radius and cluster number, and (iii) they do not reduce the dimensionality of the trajectories, and hence are unsuitable for finding collective coordinates. We advocate the application of principal component analysis (PCA) and a non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) method to reduce MD trajectories and overcome the drawbacks of clustering. To illustrate the superiority of nMDS over other methods in reducing data and reproducing salient features, we analyze three complete villin headpiece folding trajectories. Our analysis suggests that the folding process of the villin headpiece is structurally heterogeneous.},

abstract = {We present a framework for studying protein folding pathways and potential landscapes which is based on techniques recently developed in the robotics motion planning community. Our focus in this work is to study the protein folding mechanism assuming we know the native fold. That is, instead of performing fold prediction, we aim to study issues related to the folding process, such as the formation of secondary and tertiary structure, and the dependence of the folding pathway on the initial denatured conformation. Our work uses probabilistic roadmap (PRM) motion planning techniques which have proven successful for problems involving high-dimensional configuration spaces. A strength of these methods is their efficiency in rapidly covering the planning space without becoming trapped in local minima. We have applied our PRM technique to several small proteins ({\~{}}60 residues) and validated the pathways computed by comparing the secondary structure formation order on our paths to known hydrogen exchange experimental results. An advantage of the PRM framework over other simulation methods is that it enables one to easily and efficiently compute folding pathways from any denatured starting state to the (known) native fold. This aspect makes our approach ideal for studying global properties of the protein's potential landscape, most of which are difficult to simulate and study with other methods. For example, in the proteins we study, the folding pathways starting from different denatured states sometimes share common portions when they are close to the native fold, and moreover, the formation order of the secondary structure appears largely independent of the starting denatured conformation. Another feature of our technique is that the distribution of the sampled conformations is correlated with the formation of secondary structure and, in particular, appears to differentiate situations in which secondary structure clearly forms first and those in which the tertiary structure is obtained more directly. Overall, our results applying PRM techniques are very encouraging and indicate the promise of our approach for studying proteins for which experimental results are not available.},

abstract = {Classic molecular motion simulation techniques, such as Monte Carlo (MC) simulation, generate motion pathways one at a time and spend most of their time in the local minima of the energy landscape defined over a molecular conformation space. Their high computational cost prevents them from being used to compute ensemble properties (properties requiring the analysis of many pathways). This paper introduces stochastic roadmap simulation (SRS) as a new computational approach for exploring the kinetics of molecular motion by simultaneously examining multiple pathways. These pathways are compactly encoded in a graph, which is constructed by sampling a molecular conformation space at random. This computation, which does not trace any particular pathway explicitly, circumvents the local-minima problem. Each edge in the graph represents a potential transition of the molecule and is associated with a probability indicating the likelihood of this transition. By viewing the graph as a Markov chain, ensemble properties can be efficiently computed over the entire molecular energy landscape. Furthermore, SRS converges to the same distribution as MC simulation. SRS is applied to two biological problems: computing the probability of folding, an important order parameter that measures the "kinetic distance" of a protein's conformation from its native state; and estimating the expected time to escape from a ligand-protein binding site. Comparison with MC simulations on protein folding shows that SRS produces arguably more accurate results, while reducing computation time by several orders of magnitude. Computational studies on ligand-protein binding also demonstrate SRS as a promising approach to study ligand-protein interactions.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is a well-established method for studying protein motion at the atomic scale. However, it is computationally intensive and generates massive amounts of data. One way of addressing the dual challenges of computation efficiency and data analysis is to construct simplified models of long-timescale protein motion from MD simulation data. In this direction, we propose to use Markov models with hidden states, in which the Markovian states represent potentially overlapping probabilistic distributions over protein conformations. We also propose a principled criterion for evaluating the quality of a model by its ability to predict long-timescale protein motions. Our method was tested on 2D synthetic energy landscapes and two extensively studied peptides, alanine dipeptide and the villin headpiece subdomain (HP-35 NleNle). One interesting finding is that although a widely accepted model of alanine dipeptide contains six states, a simpler model with only three states is equally good for predicting long-timescale motions. We also used the constructed Markov models to estimate important kinetic and dynamic quantities for protein folding, in particular, mean first-passage time. The results are consistent with available experimental measurements.},
