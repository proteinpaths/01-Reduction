abstract = {MOTIVATION Sequence clustering replaces groups of similar sequences in a database with single representatives. Clustering large protein databases like the NCBI Non-Redundant database (NR) using even the best currently available clustering algorithms is very time-consuming and only practical at relatively high sequence identity thresholds. Our previous program, CD-HI, clustered NR at 90{\%} identity in approximately 1 h and at 75{\%} identity in approximately 1 day on a 1 GHz Linux PC (Li et al., Bioinformatics, 17, 282, 2001); however even faster clustering speed is needed because the size of protein databases are rapidly growing and many applications desire a lower attainable thresholds. RESULTS For our previous algorithm (CD-HI), we have employed short-word filters to speed up the clustering. In this paper, we show that tolerating some redundancy makes for more efficient use of these short-word filters and increases the program's speed 100 times. Our new program implements this technique and clusters NR at 70{\%} identity within 2 h, and at 50{\%} identity in approximately 5 days. Although some redundancy is present after clustering, our new program's results only differ from our previous program's by less than 0.4{\%}.},

@article{RajanSchulten10,
abstract = {Recent advances in computing technology have enabled microsecond long all-atom molecular dynamics ( MD) simulations of biological systems. Methods that can distill the salient features of such large trajectories are now urgently needed. Conventional clustering methods used to analyze MD trajectories suffer from various setbacks, namely (i) they are not data driven, (ii) they are unstable to noise and changes in cut-off parameters such as cluster radius and cluster number, and (iii) they do not reduce the dimensionality of the trajectories, and hence are unsuitable for finding collective coordinates. We advocate the application of principal component analysis (PCA) and a non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) method to reduce MD trajectories and overcome the drawbacks of clustering. To illustrate the superiority of nMDS over other methods in reducing data and reproducing salient features, we analyze three complete villin headpiece folding trajectories. Our analysis suggests that the folding process of the villin headpiece is structurally heterogeneous.},

abstract = {The ability to perform long, accurate molecular dynamics (MD) simulations involving proteins and other biological macro-molecules could in principle provide answers to some of the most important currently outstanding questions in the fields of biology, chemistry, and medicine. A wide range of biologically interesting phenomena, however, occur over timescales on the order of a millisecond---several orders of magnitude beyond the duration of the longest current MD simulations. We describe a massively parallel machine called Anton, which should be capable of executing millisecond-scale classical MD simulations of such biomolecular systems. The machine, which is scheduled for completion by the end of 2008, is based on 512 identical MD-specific ASICs that interact in a tightly coupled manner using a specialized highspeed communication network. Anton has been designed to use both novel parallel algorithms and special-purpose logic to dramatically accelerate those calculations that dominate the time required for a typical MD simulation. The remainder of the simulation algorithm is executed by a programmable portion of each chip that achieves a substantial degree of parallelism while preserving the flexibility necessary to accommodate anticipated advances in physical models and simulation methods.},

@article{Hobohm1992,
abstract = {The Protein Data Bank currently contains about 600 data sets of three-dimensional protein coordinates determined by X-ray crystallography or NMR. There is considerable redundancy in the data base, as many protein pairs are identical or very similar in sequence. However, statistical analyses of protein sequence-structure relations require nonredundant data. We have developed two algorithms to extract from the data base representative sets of protein chains with maximum coverage and minimum redundancy. The first algorithm focuses on optimizing a particular property of the selected proteins and works by successive selection of proteins from an ordered list and exclusion of all neighbors of each selected protein. The other algorithm aims at maximizing the size of the selected set and works by successive thinning out of clusters of similar proteins. Both algorithms are generally applicable to other data bases in which criteria of similarity can be defined and relate to problems in graph theory. The largest nonredundant set extracted from the current release of the Protein Data Bank has 155 protein chains. In this set, no two proteins have sequence similarity higher than a certain cutoff (30{\%} identical residues for aligned subsequences longer than 80 residues), yet all structurally unique protein families are represented. Periodically updated lists of representative data sets are available by electronic mail from the file server "netserv@embl-heidelberg.de." The selection may be useful in statistical approaches to protein folding as well as in the analysis and documentation of the known spectrum of three-dimensional protein structures.},
