abstract = {Conventional clustering methods used to analyze MD trajectories suffer from various setbacks, namely (i) they are not data driven, (ii) they are unstable to noise and changes in cut-off parameters such as cluster radius and cluster number, and (iii) they do not reduce the dimensionality of the trajectories, and hence are unsuitable for finding collective coordinates. We advocate the application of principal component analysis (PCA) and a non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) method to reduce MD trajectories and overcome the drawbacks of clustering. To illustrate the superiority of nMDS over other methods in reducing data and reproducing salient features, we analyze three complete villin headpiece folding trajectories. Our analysis suggests that the folding process of the villin headpiece is structurally heterogeneous.},

abstract = {The ability to perform long, accurate molecular dynamics (MD) simulations involving proteins and other biological macro-molecules could in principle provide answers to some of the most important currently outstanding questions in the fields of biology, chemistry, and medicine. A wide range of biologically interesting phenomena, however, occur over timescales on the order of a millisecond---several orders of magnitude beyond the duration of the longest current MD simulations. We describe a massively parallel machine called Anton, which should be capable of executing millisecond-scale classical MD simulations of such biomolecular systems. The machine, which is scheduled for completion by the end of 2008, is based on 512 identical MD-specific ASICs that interact in a tightly coupled manner using a specialized highspeed communication network. Anton has been designed to use both novel parallel algorithms and special-purpose logic to dramatically accelerate those calculations that dominate the time required for a typical MD simulation. The remainder of the simulation algorithm is executed by a programmable portion of each chip that achieves a substantial degree of parallelism while preserving the flexibility necessary to accommodate anticipated advances in physical models and simulation methods.},

@article{Toofanny2010,
abstract = {The goal of the Dynameomics project is to perform, store, and analyze molecular dynamics simulations of representative proteins, of all known globularfolds, in their native state and along their unfolding pathways. To analyze unfolding simulations, the location of the protein along the unfolding reaction coordinate (RXN) must be determined. Properties such as the fraction of native contacts and radius of gyration are often used; however, there is an issue regarding degeneracy with these properties, as native and nonnative species can overlap. Here, we used 15 physical properties of the protein to construct a multidimensional-embedded, onedimensional RXN coordinate that faithfully captures the complex nature of unfolding. The unfolding RXN coordinates for 188 proteins (1534 simulations and 22.9 s in explicit water) were calculated. Native, transition, intermediate, and denatured states were readily identified with the use of this RXN coordinate. A global native ensemble based on the native-state properties of the 188 proteins was created.This ensemble was shown to be effective for calculating RXN coordinates for folds outside the initial 188 targets.These RXN coordinates enable, high-throughput assignment of conformational states, which represents an important step in comparing protein properties across fold space as well as characterizing the unfolding of individual proteins. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {An outstanding challenge in the field of molecular biology has been to understand the process by which proteins fold into their characteristic three-dimensional structures. Here, we report the results of atomic-level molecular dynamics simulations, over periods ranging between 100 $\mu$s and 1 ms, that reveal a set of common principles underlying the folding of 12 structurally diverse proteins. In simulations conducted with a single physics-based energy function, the proteins, representing all three major structural classes, spontaneously and repeatedly fold to their experimentally determined native structures. Early in the folding process, the protein backbone adopts a nativelike topology while certain secondary structure elements and a small number of nonlocal contacts form. In most cases, folding follows a single dominant route in which elements of the native structure appear in an order highly correlated with their propensity to form in the unfolded state.},

@article{Hobohm1992,
abstract = {The Protein Data Bank currently contains about 600 data sets of three-dimensional protein coordinates determined by X-ray crystallography or NMR. There is considerable redundancy in the data base, as many protein pairs are identical or very similar in sequence. However, statistical analyses of protein sequence-structure relations require nonredundant data. We have developed two algorithms to extract from the data base representative sets of protein chains with maximum coverage and minimum redundancy. The first algorithm focuses on optimizing a particular property of the selected proteins and works by successive selection of proteins from an ordered list and exclusion of all neighbors of each selected protein. The other algorithm aims at maximizing the size of the selected set and works by successive thinning out of clusters of similar proteins. Both algorithms are generally applicable to other data bases in which criteria of similarity can be defined and relate to problems in graph theory. The largest nonredundant set extracted from the current release of the Protein Data Bank has 155 protein chains. In this set, no two proteins have sequence similarity higher than a certain cutoff (30{\%} identical residues for aligned subsequences longer than 80 residues), yet all structurally unique protein families are represented. Periodically updated lists of representative data sets are available by electronic mail from the file server "netserv@embl-heidelberg.de." The selection may be useful in statistical approaches to protein folding as well as in the analysis and documentation of the known spectrum of three-dimensional protein structures.},

abstract = {Dimensionality reduction methods have been widely used to study the free energy landscapes and low-free energy pathways of molecular systems. It was shown that the non-linear dimensionality-reduction methods gave better embedding results than the linear methods, such as principal component analysis, in some simple systems. In this study, we have evaluated several non linear methods, locally linear embedding, Isomap, and diffusion maps, as well as principal component analysis from the equilibrium folding/unfolding trajectory of the second $\beta$-hairpin of the B1 domain of streptococcal protein G. The CHARMM parm19 polar hydrogen potential function was used. A series of criteria which reflects different aspects of the embedding qualities were employed in the evaluation. Our results show that principal component analysis is not worse than the non-linear ones on this complex system. There is no clear winner in all aspects of the evaluation. Each dimensionality-reduction method has its limitations in a certain aspect. We emphasize that a fair, informative assessment of an embedding result requires a combination of multiple evaluation criteria rather than any single one. Caution should be used when dimensionality-reduction methods are employed, especially when only a few of top embedding dimensions are used to describe the free energy landscape.},
